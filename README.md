## Features

- Create presentations directly from your RemNote notes.
- Hides distracting UI elements and increases the font size using custom CSS.

## How To Use

- Create a Rem and tag it with the "Presentation" powerup.
- Use either normal Rem or portals containing single Rem to create a list of children under the Rem tagged with "Presentation". These will be the presentation slides.
  - The benefit of using portals are:
    - You don't need to move stuff around.
    - You can have multiple portals to the same Rem so you can go back and forth between the same slide if desired.
    - Note: only supports portals containing a single Rem.
- Focus the parent and run the "Start Presentation" command.
- Use the "Next/Previous Slide" commands to move forward and backward through the slides.
  - You can create a shortcut for these in the RemNote keyboard shortcut settings.
- Run the "Stop Presentation" command to end the presentation and reset the CSS.
